Now we need to create a shell script:
Open the newterminal and go to big-data-internship-program directorty and created one file daily_job.sh.
cd big-data-internship-program/
 
gedit daily_job.sh
 

Put the below code on daily_job.sh file

#!/bin/sh
echo "Running users incremental job"
sqoop job --exec inc_users
echo "Running books incremental job"
sqoop job --exec inc_books

 
Test the script: It will run incremental job for Users and books table.
sh daily_job.sh 

Now we will create entry for cronjob so that data will updated on daily basis at 10pm
Type below command then open the vi editor put below code in vi editor
crontab â€“e
0 22 * * *  sh  /home/cloudera/big-data-internship-program/daily_job.sh
